    <title>State Homeland Security Strategy</title>
    <para>
      In late 2009, the SEC participated with other State Agencies in the
      development of the State Homeland Security Strategy.  In 2010 that
      strategy was approved, and a number of objective coordinators were
      appointed to focus on the various elements of the strategy.
    </para>
    <para>
      Of particular interest to ARPSC was Goal 2:
    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <attribution>Goal 2</attribution>
      <para>
	Enhance, implement, and sustain homeland security programs.
      </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
      and in particular
    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <attribution>Objective 2.1</attribution>
      <para>
	Annually identify planning needs to improve capabilities
        and address changing conditions by August 30.
      </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
      The Section has committed to contribute to the State's progress against
      this objective by preparing a number of planning documents.  Some of these
      documents have been completed, and a number are scheduled for 2011.

    <para>
      Because many of these documents contain sensitive information, the SEC has
      developed a "library" on the website where these documents can be easily
      found and, if necessary, password protected.  DECs and Net Managers have
      been given password access, and it is anticipated that most ECs will also
      require access.  Each program within the Section has a dedicated area
      within the library.

      It is anticipated that documents within the library will be available in a
      number of formats; html for online access, pdf for printed output, ePub
      for portable devices, and plain text for packet BBSs and similar
      low-bandwidth devices.
