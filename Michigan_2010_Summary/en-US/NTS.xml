    <title>National Traffic System</title>
    <para>
      Michigan's National Traffic System consists of amateurs who send messages
      (called "traffic") around the Section and around the nation.  These
      amateurs are organized into a group of on the air nets that meet
      frequently with the intent of passing messages.  These are the "unsung
      heros" of ARPSC; many practice their skill every day, but they operate
      behind the scene, out of the eye of the served agencies and the public.
    </para>
    <para>
      The individual nets report monthly.  Michigan nets send approximately 1000
      messages a month.  In 2010, they reported 13,848 messages passed.  Not all
      traffic is reported, although the large number of non-reporting nets
      probably pass a small fraction of the messages. The chart below shows the
      performance across the year:

      page allow for viewing of previous reports or individual net history.
    </para>
    <para>
      Michigan amateurs also participate in other nets.  The Eighth Region net
      takes messages destined for out of state addresses, and collects traffic
      bound for Michigan to pass to Michigan representatives who will then carry
      those messages to the Michigan nets.  The Eastern Area Net interfaces
      with the Region nets to move traffic among the Regions in the Eastern
      Area.  The Transcontinental Corps arranges to move traffic between the
      Areas.  Michigan amateurs participate in all of these, however that effort
      is not reflected in Michigan reporting.

      <para>
	The bulk of the traffic is passed through ten affiliated nets.  Each net
	has an appointed net manager, responsible for arranging net controls and
	liaisons to other nets, and for reporting monthly to the Section Traffic
	Manager.
      </para>

	The affiliated nets and their net managers are:

	To be eligible for affiliation, a net must report regularly and maintain
	liaison with other National Traffic System nets.
      </para>
      <para>
	In addition, there are perhaps 40 other nets operating within the state,
	approximately ten of which report regularly.

      <para>
	The STM has a small number of assistants who engage in
	projects such as liaison with other entities, training, and
	administrative duties:
