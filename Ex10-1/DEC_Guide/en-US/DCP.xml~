      One obvious failure that was exposed is the lack of adequate
      plans for communications among the counties in a District.
      Certainly there has been discussion, and also discussion about
      communications between Districts.  But before we develop between
      District plans, we need to have the problem solved within a
      District.

      </indexterm>
      Many counties, and even a few Districts, have call trees
      established, although these are rarely up to date.  Certainly,
      we should use every technology at our disposal, and the
      telephone is a common, and reliable mode.

      However, this mode will not work if the numbers are out of date,
      if we only have home numbers and people are away from their
      phones, or, of course, if the phones are out.  These systems
      need to be tested frequently, but backup mechanisms must also be
      in place.
