      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
	During any statewide exercise, each program often wants to test circuits
	from their local EOC to the State EOC.  Limited opportunities will be
	available during this exercise.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>HF Phone</title>
      <para>
	Because we wish to engage all the HF nets, the HF phone capability of
	the SEOC will be exhausted during this exercise.  Direct contact over HF
	phone from the individual counties is unwelcome for this exercise.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>HF CW</title>
      <para>
	To accomodate direct communications with individual counties, the SEOC
	will monitor 3.563 MHz CW from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM during the exercise.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>HF Digital</title>
      <para>
	The SEOC will not be using HF digital modes during the exercise.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>VHF/UHF Phone</title>
      <para>
	This is a simplex exercise.  As such, VHF phone connections will not be
	appropriate from most programs.  To accomodate nearby programs or
	VHF/UHF relays, the SEOC will monitor 147.54 MHz and 446.00 MHz from
	10:00 AM to 11:00 AM.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>VHF Packet</title>
      <para>
	The SEOC will be available to receive formal traffic on
	<email>seoc@seoc.ampr.org</email>. Replies may or may not be timely.
	The station will also monitor CONV channel 911.
