      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
	In order to engage all the affiliated nets, and to also encourage the
	DECs to develop relationships with their local VHF net, traffic will
	be routed through all the nets.
      </para>
      <para>
	At the beginning of the exercise, the SEOC will transmit queries to each
	District through HF nets.  These messages will flow through NTS to each
	District.  The nature of the query will require that the District query
	each of it's counties.  The result will then be pushed back through NTS
	ultimately arrivng at the SEOC via an HF net.

      <title>Traffic Flow</title>
      <para>
	Four HF nets will meet in sequence receiving traffic from the SEOC.
	Each of these nets will include representatives from a VHF net.  These
	reps will then take the traffic to the VHF net for delivery to the
	District.  After composing a response, the District will deliver it's
	answer to that same VHF net, who in turn will send a representative to
	one of two HF nets meeting with the SEOC later in the morning.

      <title>Net Schedule</title>
      <para>
	Each HF net has a specific time slot with the SEOC.  It is presumed that
	the VHF net will meet following the HF meeting at the beginning of the
	exercise, and before the HF net at the end of the exercise.
