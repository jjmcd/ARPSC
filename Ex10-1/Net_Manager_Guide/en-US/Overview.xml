    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      Over the past several years, many people have asked for more
      exercises.  This year the section hopes to have at least three,
      including the annual SET.  The first of these is planned for
      April.

    <title>Driving Forces</title>
    <para>
      The 2009 SET exposed several serious shortcomings in our level
      of readiness.  The target of this exercise will be to help
      develop capabilities to fill those shortcomings.

      To address these needs, we hope to accomplish one basic target;
      communications from and to the State Emergency Operations Center
      using formalized, predefined circuits.

      Communications for the exercise will be accomplished using
      point-to-point phone circuits, both VHF and HF.  CW and packet
      circuits will be available for those counties who wish to test
      direct communications to the SEOC, but the primary exercise
      objectives will be carried out over phone circuits.
