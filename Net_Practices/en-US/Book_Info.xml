    <para>
      Over the years, the various NTS nets in the section have developed various
      procedures and protocols, each different from the other.  Each net has
      developed strengths and weakness which, by and large, have not been shared
      with other nets.

    <para>
      This document is an attempt to capture some of the better ideas from the
      various nets so the knowledge may be shared among the nets.
