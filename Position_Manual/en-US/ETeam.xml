      <para>
	As a general rule, the station staff maintains the RACES Situation
	Report (SitRep) since the SEC frequently does not have a terminal.
	However, if for some reason the station staff is unable to maintain the
	SitRep, it falls on the SEC or his delegate to do so.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is important to many agencies to be alert to the state of readiness
	of the RACES station. Agencies have discovered that their communications
	circuits are sometimes fragile, and they may require our services.  An
	up to date and accurate SitRep gives them some confidence about our
	status. 
      </para>
      <para>
	In any case, be sure the Agency SitRep is complete, accurate, and up to
	date.
