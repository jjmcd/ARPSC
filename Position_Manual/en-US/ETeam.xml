<chapter>
  <title>MI CIMS</title>

  <section>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
	The coordinator will spend much of the time focusing on
	activity in the <application>MI CIMS</application> and keeping
	status updated in that application.  This is the communication
	tool not only to the other agencies, but also to personnel in
	the affected area.  It also provides critical documentation
	for the incident which is needed for the After Action Report,
	the SEOC SitRep for the operational period, and for any
	Federal or State aid that may be required following the
	incident.
      </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Situation Report</title>
    <para>
      The coordinator should establish an agency SitRep immediately on
      after notifying the affected jurisdictions.  Navigate to
      <guilabel>SEOC Situation Report - Agency List</guilabel> and
      select <guilabel>AuxComm</guilabel> from the list.
    </para>
    <para>
      <warning>
        <title>The Executive Summary will become part of the SEOC
        Situation Report</title>
	<para>
	  Be sure to update that section of the agency SitRep each
	  operational period and be sure that it is framed in such a
	  way as to be useful as a part of the SEOC Situation Report.
	  Other sections may be more specific, but the
	  <guilabel>Executive Summary</guilabel> will be viewed by a
	  wider audience.
	</para>
	</warning>
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Activity Log</title>
    <para>
      Any significant occurrence, or even notes, should be recorded in
      the <guilabel>Activity Log</guilabel>. This is a log of our
      actions for later reference, and is private unless one of three
      boxes at the bottom of the board have been checked:
    </para>
    <para>
      <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <guilabel>Post to SEOC Significant Events</guilabel>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <guilabel>Post to Statewide Significant Events</guilabel>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    <guilabel>REP</guilabel>
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>
    <para>
      For any occurrence that should be brought to the attention of the
      SEOC staff, the appropriate box should be ticked.  This will
      cause the record to be displayed on one of the other boards in
      addition to the <guilabel>Activity Log</guilabel>.
    </para>
    <para>
      A new record in the <guilabel>Activity Log</guilabel> may be
      created by clicking the <guilabel>New Record</guilabel> button
      at the top of the board.  Text may be added <emphasis>to the
      top</emphasis> of an existing record by clicking the
      <guilabel>Update Record</guilabel> button at the bottom of the
      record.
    </para>
    <para>
      All records are timestamped.  The timestamp for the creation of
      a new record appears to the left of the record.  Each entry
      within the record has a timestamp at the bottom of the entry.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>AuxComm Station Status</title>
    <para>
      The coordinator should remind the station to maintain their
      status in the <guilabel> AuxComm Station Status</guilabel>
      board.  Not only should current
      <guilabel>OPEN</guilabel>/<guilabel>CLOSED</guilabel> status and
      current frequencies be up to date, but any occurrences of
      interest should be recorded in the <guilabel>Situation
      Update</guilabel> section.  Like other entries, additions to
      this section are timestamped.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>AuxComm Message Log</title>
    <para>
      The coordinator must also keep abreast of the <guilabel>AuxComm
      Message Log</guilabel>.  The coordinator may enter messages in
      that board on receipt, or the station may initiate the entry.
      When the delivering station has <application>MI
      CIMS</application> access, then the delivering station should
      update the delivery details.  However, it may often fall on the
      SEOC station to discover and record the delivery.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Situational Awareness</title>
    <para>
      There are many other items within the <application>MI
      CIMS</application> that the coordinator must follow in order to
      stay up to date on the progress of the incident.
    </para>

    <para>
      Most critical are the <guilabel>SEOC Significant
      Events</guilabel> board, the <guilabel>Statewide Significant
      Events</guilabel> board, and the the <guilabel>Local Significant
      Events</guilabel> board.  Any time any of these turns red in the
      menu, the coordinator should check the board, understand the
      update, and potentially, notify the station.  Chances are the
      station cannot follow all the significant events, so needs to be
      advised of anything of consequence to them.  This, of course,
      includes the MARS station as well as the ARES station.
    </para>

    <para>
      The coordinator must always be alert to the <guilabel>Battle
      Rhythm</guilabel> board.  Typically this will be displayed on
      one of the large screens, but it notifies the coordinator of
      upcoming briefings.
    </para>
    <para>
      The other available boards are useful, and at times, the various
      dashboards can be especially useful, and when possible the
      coordinator should stay up to date on all the boards, but the
      boards mentioned above are especially critical.
    </para>

<!--
    <para>
      In addition to the SitRep, the rep should record any significant
      occurrences in entering the SEOC.  The same SitRep will be
      maintained by the coordinator and the station.  Encourage the
      station to make frequent updates when contacts are made relevant
      to the incident.  The coordinator's updates will typically be
      summaries of station activities as well as information on other
      leadership the coordinator has contacted by telephone.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is important to many agencies to be alert to the state of readiness
	of the RACES station. Agencies have discovered that their communications
	circuits are sometimes fragile, and they may require our services.  An
	up to date and accurate SitRep gives them some confidence about our
	status. 
      </para>
      <para>
	In any case, be sure the Agency SitRep is complete, accurate, and up to
	date.  The SitRep should be updated at least once per hour.
