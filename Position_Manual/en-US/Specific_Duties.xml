      <title>Checking In</title>
      <para>
	On arrival, sign in at the front door.  If the rep or alternate
	does not have a pass card, an officer will escort him to the
	security station.
      </para>
      <para>
	Once appropriately signed in, enter the EOC, pick up the copy
	of this position manual in the bookshelf near the door, and go
	to the Auxcomm desk (Second row, left most two chairs when
	facing the command diaz).  Note that the coordinator is
	expected to have the official copy of this document at the
	desk.
      </para>
      <para>
	Log on to <application>MI-CIMS</application>, make an entry in
	the Activity Log noting you are in the SEOC.  Make the record
	shared with agency and SEOC.

    <section>
      <title>Assessing the situation</title>
      <para>
	The rep must first get a feel for the current situation. On
	<application>MI CIMS</application>, quickly review the
	<guilabel>Incident Action Plan</guilabel>, if one is
	available.  Also, review the most recent entries in the
	<guilabel>SEOC Significant Events</guilabel> and the
	<guilabel>Statewide Significant Events</guilabel>
	boards.

	This should be done quickly so that the jurisdiction
	can be contacted.  Often there will be considerable detail to
	be studied, but first the jurisdiction must be contacted.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Contact local jurisdiction</title>
      <para>
	When the SEOC has been activated, one of the first tasks is to
	contact the DEC for the affected jurisdiction.  In many cases,
	of course, the DEC may have contacted the SEC in the first
	place.  Even in those cases, contact the DEC so (s)he is aware
	that the SEOC is activated. (<xref linkend="appe-DEC" />)
      </para>
      <para>
	The local ECs affected must also be notified.  When speaking
	with the DEC, decide whether the DEC will notify the ECs or
	whether they will each get a call from Harris Drive.
	(<xref linkend="appe-EC" />)
      </para>
      <para>
	Be sure to determine, whether through the DEC or directly with
	the ECs, the communications circuits to be used between the
	SEOC and the local EOC.
      </para>
      <para>
	After contacting the DEC, then contact the Net Manager of the
	net responsible for the affected District.
	(<xref linkend="appe-NM" />)
      </para>
      <para>
	Advise leaders of CAP, MARS and SATERN of the activation.
	They will most likely not be required to respond, but they
	should be aware of the incident.
      </para>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <title>Situation Report</title>
      <para>
	After the initial contacts have been made, review the
	<guilabel>Incident Action Plan</guilabel> once again, paying
	attention to the incident objectives.  If there is no IAP yet,
	there may be an <guilabel>ICS-202 Incident
	Objectives</guilabel> under the <guilabel>Reference
	Info</guilabel> menu.  Take care, depending on the incident,
	there may be a 202 <emphasis>per agency</emphasis>.  Be sure
	to select a relevant 202.
      </para>
      <para>
	Under <guilabel> SEOC Situation Report- Agency
	List</guilabel>, <guilabel>AuxComm</guilabel>,
	<guilabel>Edit Record</guilabel> enter the three
	<emphasis>Auxcomm</emphasis> objectives for the incident.
	Consider the objectives for the next operational period
	(e.g. where will you get resources).  List any concerns you
	have.

	Returning to the top of the form, briefly summarize the
	Auxcomm situation in the <guilabel>EXECUTIVE
	SUMMARY</guilabel> field. This will become part of the of the
	<guilabel>SEOC Situation Report - Published</guilabel> so it
	wants to be at a very high level.  If the Auxcomm section of
	the <guilabel>SEOC Situation Report - Published</guilabel>
	should be blank, leave this blank.
      </para>
      <para>
	From time to time come back to this board to update the
	situation.  Occasionally, the Planning Section will ask for
	this form to be complete. When that happens, review the board
	to be sure it says what you want to say.
      </para>
    </section>
      

    <section>
      <title>Liaison with the station</title>
      <para>
	One of the rep's primary function is to provide a
	communications path between the station status and the various
	agencies.
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Apprise the various agencies of the current station status if
	      needed
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Communicate the current status of the field situation, as
	      understood by the SEOC, to the station.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Alert the station of any communications needs of the agencies.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	If possible, spend some time with the operators prior to the exercise to
	understand the situation there.
      </para>
      <para>
	The coordinator will typically communicate with the station via
	telephone.  See <xref linkend="appe-SEOC" /> for numbers.
      </para>
      <warning>
	<title>Things change</title>
	<para>
	  The SEOC facility is new, the phones may not be permanent,
	  and the intercom system might not yet be functional.  You
	  may need to physically check the phone number in the
	  station, and/or communicate with the station via HT.
	</para>
      </warning>
      <para>
	The coordinator and the station should also agree on a backup
	communications plan.  Typically, the coordinator and a station
	op should have HTs.  A simplex channel should be agreed upon
	since the station's primary VHF radio will likely be
	monitoring a repeater involved in, or relaying for, the
	incident.
      </para>
      <para>
	Stay in regular touch with the station; be aware of their
	situation and whether they are in contact with the site.  Keep
	them up to date as to site changes as announced in the SEOC.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the MARS station is active, be sure to stay abreast of the
	MARS SitRep and include them in hourly updates.  Similarly if
	REACT, SATERN or other services are involved.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Requests</title>
      <para>
	From time to time, the Logistics chief or the Ops chief may
	ask for status information from the field or other
	communications into the affected area.  Be aware of the
	available circuits and field resources so that these requests
	may be routed most effectively.  Keep in mind that event
	though their resources are limited, MARS may well have
	personnel in an appropriate position to respond to the
	request. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Often, we are the only agency with a communications focus. In
	effect, the AuxComm EMC becomes the Communications Unit
	leader. Do not be surprised if the request is far outside a
	simple radiogram, and consider both your unique skills, and
	the considerable resources available at the SEOC to respond to
	the request.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Agency Announcements</title>
      <para>
	Periodically, the Director or Ops Section Chief will ask for
	agency updates.  Give a brief status of the station for each
	update.  Keep in mind that the agency reps are non-technical,
	but most realize that we are their backup plan.  Give a
	meaningful status without getting technical.  Where possible
	get information on the program status at the local
	jurisdiction and, if significant, pass this along to the other
	agencies as well.
      </para>
      <para>
	Pay attention to the other agency reports.  Should they need
	us our job will be eased if we at least have some familiarity
	with their situation.
      </para>
      <para>
	Consider updating the station with any interesting items from
	the other agencies.  Depending on the drill and players, there
	may be EOCs on the converse bridge unaware of the situation at
	the site and in need of update.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Debrief</title>
      <para>
	At the end of the exercise, there will be a debrief from all
	agencies.  Prior to this check with the station operators to
	be sure you are aware of any contact with the site or nearby
	jurisdictions.  Often, the station operators may be invited
	into the SEOC for the final debrief.
      </para>
      <para>
	Make a positive, brief presentation when asked.  As usual, avoid
	technical details and focus on capability.
